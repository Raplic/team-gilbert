This is the main repository for the Stage 1 HackBio'2020 Virtual Internship Experience. <br> The tasks are to team up in maximum number of 10, and give your team a name <br> Pick any linux based bioinformatics software <br> Install the software on a collaborative linux environment <br> (If your software does not require a strict linux environment, then you don't need to install it) <br> Find any small biological data that can be analyzed by the software (not more than 1GB); upload it on the server <br> Create a google drive folder for your team <br> Analyse the data, provide visualization or tables as applicable, with adequate captions in a google doc file <br> Make a 5-10 minutes video record of how you implemented the software using as much technical terms as possible. Add to the google folder <br> Create a tweet that explains your analysis in a way that even a fool will understand.
